# Tabletop robot
My tabletop robot essentially wanders around a table and doesn't fall off. When the sensors find the edge of the table, it knows that it is about to fall off, and the robot turns around. The machine uses two DC motors to move around, a motor driver, and an Arduino.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was building the main structure of the car and making it move. I added the wheels and the motors to the bottom of the baseplate to allow the robot to drive around. I added the L298N Motor Driver on top of the baseplate, and it is used to easily control the direction and speed of the 2 DC motors. The Motor Driver connects to the battery and the motors with wires, and it also connects to the Arduino. With the Arduino IDE, I programmed my tabletop robot to move back and forth by making the wheels move in the same direction. To make it turn, I had to make the two wheels roll in different directions.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the TV-B-Gone. It uses infrared lights to send a signal to the tv, which can turn it off. Some other components used are a ceramic resonator, a microcontroller, transistors, and a button. The button is for the user to press,  and when switched on, it turns the lights on and off by emitting IR codes. The ceramic resonator acts almost as a metronome  for the microcontoller. It tells the microcontroller how long a microsecond is, and the microcontroller uses that information to figure out when to blink the IR LEDs. The transistors amplify the power of the microcontroller and control the currents passed through the LED. One thing I enjoyed while doing this project was seeing it all come together and work in the end. One thing I struggled with was soldering and some other aspects of the assembly process, but after doing it a few times, I got the hang of it.
